# Dossier-Project
This is a project for Junior year Ib Dossier project

This is an mp3 player, I decided to make a program that allows me to listen to music, as long as I can supplement the music. It was also hard because you could not instal programs on school computers, and since most computers have java installed on them, running this program would be easy, and a good learning project.

This was also built in order for me to understand Java, and create a bigger java project, than what we make in class

This program, can add music by taking a music file that the user supplies and then moving it into a folder that the program can use.

The program can then use the music to create custom playlists for the user

The program can then play the music from the general playlists or custom playlists that the user can create

While playing the music the user can shuffle the music, play, pause, and get the meta data about the music, such as singer, album and so on


In order to run this program you must download the src file off the github, and then import into eclipse, and run.(working on making it better to run)

If you want a demosntration of how my skills have developed look to the Grade book project, as that project was made in my senior year
compared to my junior year for this program.
